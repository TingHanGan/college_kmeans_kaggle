# ## Findings about identified clusters
Graduation rate is the probability that they will graduate in % while outstate is the amount of people in the college that went for out-state tuition. By clustering, 2 groups have been identified. It is seen that college with around 2500 â€“ 11300 people going for outstate tuition have randomly scattered values between 5% - 100%. Whereas for colleges that have more people going to outstate tuition, there is more of a clear distribution around 40% - 100%. Therefore, in general, there is a higher graduation rate for the college when more students attend outstate tuition.
